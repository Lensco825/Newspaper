        Why i decided to learn coding at an Early Age

        	Last year when I was 12 years old I decided to start learning code by learning web development. I fell in love with it learning new stuff every day, but now it's 2022, and when I look back I ask myself why did I want to know code? It actually comes from a deep passion for robotics and video games.</p>

	<p>When I was little I would love playing video games and watching Boston Dynamics videos, so I've always wondered how I could make them too. The first time I ever tried learning code was when I was 9, but I realized it was too tricky and gave up on that. However, I still had an amazing passion for video games and robotics till I eventually watched an hour long videos of how they were made. Then, last year during winter break i decided that i should take this time to learn code.</p>

	
	<p>>So far it's been slower than i thought, i've ad lots of burnouts but even though i don't have a lot of projects i've been studying alot. I plan on using my skills to be a front-end developer at an early age, but my real dream is too be a software engineer at Nasa or making my own computer science and engineering company! I think other teenagers should learn coding at an early age too for all the experiance they'll have in the future. You don't need to force yourself though, you can never be too old to learn code and i think the same goes for how young!
