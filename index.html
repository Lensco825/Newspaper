				Why i decided to learn coding at an Early Age

				Last year when I was 12 years old I decided to start learning code by learning web development. I fell
				in love with it learning new stuff every day, but now it's 2022, and when I look back I ask myself why
				did I want to know code? It actually comes from a deep passion for robotics and video games.</p>

			<p>When I was little I would love playing video games and watching Boston Dynamics videos, so I've always
				wondered how I could make them too. The first time I ever tried learning code was when I was 9, but I
				realized it was too tricky and gave up on that. However, I still had an amazing passion for video games
				and robotics till I eventually watched an hour long videos of how they were made. Then, last year during
				winter break i decided that i should take this time to learn code.</p>
        
			<p>So far it's been slower than i thought, i've had lots of burnouts but even though i don't have a lot of
				projects i've been studying alot. I plan on using my skills to be a front-end developer at an early age,
				but my real dream is too be a software engineer at Nasa or making my own computer science and
				engineering company! I think other teenagers should learn coding at an early age too for all the
				experiance they'll have in the future. You don't need to force yourself though, you can never be too old
				to learn code and i think the same goes for how young!

      <h1>Is it hard to learn code?</h1>
      <p>Think of coding as a new language your learning, it takes lots of practice and experiance to master it. However, if you stop coding you might forget what you've learned. It really is a long path but once your used to running on it you'll be fine! Learning programmic code doesn't just mean remember every single thing you've learned, but you also have to solve problems wether using an algorithim or with another users help. You could also use the help of others when doing a project with code.  Look at this website for example, even though i mostly made the layout and articles, there were still some problems with it like switching themes and stylizing the login button.</p>
      <p>You can also think of coding as the future. With robotics and new technology coming in the next few decades there will be more jobs that ask for coders to programm robots or new software. So there's a big chance that learning code may get you a good job in the future!</p>

      <p>During the past few years software has been made to make coding and web development easier such as using Wix, so is it true? Do we need to choice another career before we suddenly lose our jobs?</p>
